## Research: Trustworthy AI
Currently working on TRUST (Transparent, Robust and Ultra-Sparse Trees), the most interpretable model tree algorithm ever created. Preliminary results (coming soon) show that it is at least as accurate as off-the-shelf state-of-the-art models, including deep neural networks, XGBoost, Random Forest, splines and RuleFit. 
Prior work focused on ensemble pruning as a way to improve both accuracy and interpretability of tree ensembles.
Earlier still I did research on quantitative financial risk management, analyzing the efficacy of stop-loss rules.
